# Basic Information on "Buddha Weeps in Jadugora"

## Documentary Details

"Buddha Weeps in Jadugora" is a documentary film released in 1999, directed by Shriprakash (also credited as Sriprakash in some sources). The film has a runtime of 55 minutes and was produced in India. The documentary is also known by its alternate title "Ragi, kanam ko bonga buru" in some regions. It received a screening in Japan on November 19, 2011, though this appears to be a later release date rather than its original premiere.

## Synopsis

The documentary focuses on the devastating impacts of uranium mining on the tribal people (Adivasi) living near the Jadugoda mine, mill, and tailings dam in the East Singhbhum district of Jharkhand, India. For approximately 30 years, the Uranium Corporation of India Limited (UCIL) has conducted mining operations in this area, resulting in the deposit of radioactive waste into rice fields owned by the local Adivasi communities.

The film documents how unsafe mining practices, milling operations, and tailings management by UCIL have led to severe environmental and health consequences. These include excessive radiation, contamination of water, land, and air, destruction of the local ecology, and serious health impacts on the local population.

The health effects documented in the film include genetic mutations, congenital defects in newborns, various forms of cancer, and other radiation-related diseases. The documentary portrays how the Adivasi people have unknowingly utilized contaminated water and land, leading to these tragic health outcomes.

Beyond the environmental and health impacts, the film also attempts to depict what it describes as the "gross misuse of power by the authorities" in displacing the original inhabitants of the region. It highlights the apparent lack of concern for internationally accepted safety norms and precautions in handling uranium and its by-products, and the callousness regarding the disastrous impact on the people and the region.

## Production Context

The documentary was produced by Kritika and appears to have been created as an effort to bring attention to the environmental and human rights issues faced by the Adivasi communities in Jadugoda. The film falls under the subject tags of Asia, environment, health, and human rights, indicating its focus on the intersection of these important social issues.

The title "Buddha Weeps in Jadugora" is metaphorical, suggesting that the peaceful and compassionate principles associated with Buddha are being violated by the suffering inflicted on the people of Jadugoda through these mining activities.
