# Project Objectives and Scope: Environmental and Societal Impact of Uranium Mining in Jadugora

## Project Overview
This data science project aims to analyze and model the environmental, local, and societal consequences of uranium mining operations in Jadugora, located in the state of Jharkhand, India. The project will utilize various data sources, machine learning techniques, and cloud-based deployment to create a comprehensive assessment framework that can inform policy decisions, community interventions, and environmental remediation efforts.

## Research Questions
1. What are the quantifiable environmental impacts of uranium mining activities in Jadugora, particularly regarding radiation levels, soil contamination, and water quality?
2. How have these environmental changes correlated with health outcomes in local communities over time?
3. What socioeconomic factors have been most significantly affected by mining operations?
4. Can predictive models accurately forecast future environmental and health impacts based on current mining practices?
5. What are the spatial patterns of environmental degradation and health impacts in relation to proximity to mining sites?

## Key Metrics and Variables
### Environmental Metrics
- Radiation levels in soil, water, and air (measured in microsieverts or becquerels)
- Heavy metal concentrations in soil and water samples
- Water quality indicators (pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity)
- Land use changes and deforestation rates
- Tailings dam integrity and waste management effectiveness

### Health Metrics
- Incidence rates of radiation-related diseases (cancers, genetic disorders)
- Birth defect rates and reproductive health indicators
- Mortality rates compared to regional and national averages
- Chronic disease prevalence in mining-adjacent communities

### Socioeconomic Metrics
- Employment patterns and economic dependency on mining
- Displacement and resettlement statistics
- Changes in agricultural productivity and food security
- Access to healthcare, education, and clean water
- Community perception and quality of life indicators

## Geographical and Temporal Scope
- **Geographical Focus**: Primary focus on Jadugora and surrounding villages within a 20km radius of mining operations
- **Secondary Analysis**: Comparative assessment with control regions in Jharkhand with similar demographics but no mining activity
- **Temporal Range**: Historical data from pre-mining period (where available) through present day, with emphasis on the last 30 years of operations

## Technical Approach
1. **Data Collection and Integration**:
   - Compile environmental monitoring data from government and independent sources
   - Gather health records and demographic data from local health facilities and census
   - Collect socioeconomic indicators through available datasets and surveys
   - Integrate satellite imagery and GIS data for spatial analysis

2. **Analytical Methods**:
   - Time series analysis of environmental and health trends
   - Spatial analysis and hotspot mapping of impacts
   - Statistical modeling of relationships between mining activities and outcomes
   - Machine learning for pattern recognition and predictive modeling

3. **Machine Learning Applications**:
   - Predictive models for environmental contamination spread
   - Classification models for identifying high-risk areas
   - Regression models for quantifying relationships between mining intensity and health outcomes
   - Anomaly detection for identifying unusual patterns in environmental or health data

4. **Cloud and MLOps Implementation**:
   - Automated data pipelines for continuous integration of new data
   - Version-controlled model development and deployment
   - Monitoring systems for model performance and drift detection
   - Interactive dashboards and reporting tools for stakeholders

## Expected Deliverables
1. Cleaned and processed datasets with documentation
2. Interactive visualization dashboard for exploring relationships
3. Suite of machine learning models with performance metrics
4. Cloud-deployed application with API access
5. Comprehensive technical documentation and user guides
6. Detailed PDF report with findings, implications, and recommendations

## Ethical Considerations
- Ensure privacy and anonymization of health and demographic data
- Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties in the analysis
- Consider community perspectives and indigenous knowledge
- Present balanced findings that accurately represent both positive and negative impacts
- Provide actionable insights that can benefit affected communities

## Success Criteria
- Development of models with acceptable predictive accuracy (>80%)
- Successful deployment of end-to-end MLOps pipeline
- Creation of accessible and interpretable visualizations and reports
- Generation of actionable insights for stakeholders
- Comprehensive documentation enabling reproducibility and extension of the work
